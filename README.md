## Introduction

This script is designed for GTA 5 FiveM servers to enhance the underwater experience by muffling the environmental sounds and player voices. It uses available audio submix functionalities to simulate the realistic audio effects one would expect when submerged underwater.

## Features

- **Underwater Sound Effects**: Environmental sounds and player voices are muffled when the player is underwater.
- **Realistic Audio Experience**: Provides a more immersive experience by replicating the underwater audio environment.

## Installation

2. Extract the downloaded files to your FiveM server's resource directory.
3. Add `ensure UnderwaterSoundEffects` to your server.cfg file.
4. Restart your FiveM server.

## Usage

The script will automatically apply the underwater sound effects when a player goes underwater. There are no additional commands or configurations required.
